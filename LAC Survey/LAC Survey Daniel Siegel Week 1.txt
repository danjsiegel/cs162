Assignment: LAC Survey

1. How would you model the individual item?
I would model individual with a unique product ID. In that product ID, I would code in 2 metadata fields, Category and Sub Category and unique product id. 
IE 555-333-12345 555=category, 333=sub category, 12345 = unique ID; That product ID would be the key field, with the bar code and item description and price.

2. How would you model a collection of items?
A collection of Items would just be a list of the product ID and the quantity. UX teams would determine what information is queried and displayed based on the product ID Key.
3. When scanning the bar code, you should be able to retrieve the item description and price. How would you model that inventory?

4. The inventory is potentially big. How would you speed up the retrieval
process?
