==17018== Your program just tried to execute an instruction that Valgrind
==17018== did not recognise.  There are two possible reasons for this.
==17018== 1. Your program has a bug and erroneously jumped to a non-code
==17018==    location.  If you are running Memcheck and you just saw a
==17018==    warning about a bad jump, it's probably your program's fault.
==17018== 2. The instruction is legitimate but Valgrind doesn't handle it,
==17018==    i.e. it's Valgrind's fault.  If you think this is the case or
==17018==    you are not sure, please let us know and we'll try to fix it.
==17018== Either way, Valgrind will now raise a SIGILL signal which will
==17018== probably kill your program.
